# Battery Efficiency Models

Based on the analysis and experiments conducted, it is recommended to use the Ridge Regression model for predicting the remaining useful life of the battery. Here are the reasons for this recommendation and the rejection of other models:

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model: While LSTM models are powerful and capable of capturing long-term dependencies in sequence data, they are computationally intensive and require significant memory. This makes them unsuitable for deployment on edge computing devices like microcontrollers (TIC2000, Infineon Tricore, Renesas RH850, etc.), which have limited computational resources.
Polynomial Regression Model: Polynomial regression models can fit complex, non-linear relationships in the data. However, they are prone to overfitting, especially for higher-degree polynomials. Overfitting leads to poor generalization performance on unseen data. Moreover, similar to LSTM, Polynomial Regression models can also be computationally intensive, making them less ideal for deployment on microcontrollers.
Linear Regression Model: Linear regression models are simple, efficient, and require less computational resources, making them suitable for deployment on microcontrollers. However, they may not capture complex, non-linear relationships in the data as effectively as some other models. In your case, the Linear Regression model achieved high accuracy, but if computational efficiency is a priority, and the accuracy trade-off is acceptable, it can be considered.
Ridge Regression Model: Ridge Regression is a regularization technique that solves some problems of Linear Regression like overfitting, non-robustness, and ill-posedness. By adding a degree of bias to the regression estimates, Ridge Regression reduces the standard errors and restricts the coefficients to avoid overfitting. This makes the model more robust, generalizable, and better-suited for your task. Moreover, Ridge Regression models are computationally efficient and can be deployed on microcontrollers.
In conclusion, considering the balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, the Ridge Regression model is recommended for your task. However, depending on the specific microcontroller and its computational capacity, the Linear Regression model can also be a viable option if the slight trade-off in accuracy is acceptable
